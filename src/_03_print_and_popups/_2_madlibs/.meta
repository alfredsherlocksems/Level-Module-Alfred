  ## Goal:


  Have you ever played Madlibs? You will get to use input and message dialogs to join
  Strings and build your own Madlib story.


  ## Steps:


  1. Find the Madlibs ecipe program ( MadlibsOfTheAmazon.java ) and open it using
  Eclipse.

  2. Follow the instructions in the program to help you make a hilarious story about
  crossing a piranha-infested river.

  3. You can invent your own madlib story too!
